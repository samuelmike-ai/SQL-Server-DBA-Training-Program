🧠 IGR FRAMEWORK: The AI Methodology That Changes Everything

Most AI tools create surface-level content. The IGR Framework creates complete, adaptive systems.

What makes it revolutionary?

1️⃣ FOUNDATION PASS: Comprehensive requirement gathering
2️⃣ REFINEMENT PASS: Strategic questioning for perfect customization  
3️⃣ MASTERPIECE PASS: Integration with advanced methodologies

Result? A SQL Server DBA training program that:
• Optimizes for ANY hardware configuration
• Scales from 3 months to 2 years
• Balances Oracle + SQL Server + Python + Azure
• Creates job-ready professionals in 720 hours

Traditional approach: Rigid, one-size-fits-all
IGR approach: Adaptive, personalized, modular

This same framework can create training for:
👨‍💻 Web Development
👩‍🔬 Data Science  
☁️ Cloud Architecture
🔒 Cybersecurity
📱 Mobile Development

The future of AI-human collaboration is here. It's called MiniMax Agent.
